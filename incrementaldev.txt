*This will be the model I will use for the semester*

Method: Incremental Development

First iteration:
	- Design:
		○ Create database for courses
		○ Create database for users
	- Testing: 
		○ Can add/remove/edit data in those databases
		○ Basic program to take user input and send straight to SQL (no input validation) 

2nd Iteration:
	- Design: bare bones of user input program
		○ Create the user types:
			□ Student
				□ Functions: 
					® Register for class
					® See available classes 
					® See their own schedule
			□ Instructor
				□ Functions:
					® See their own courses
					® See available course
					® See the course roster
			□ Admin
				□ Functions:
					® Can see everything(student/instructor courses and rosters)
					® Add/remove courses
					® Add/remove users
					® Edit users/instructors/courses
	- Testing:
		○ Test that each type of user can perform their functions
		○ Look at the databases before and after to verify

3rd iteration
	- Design:
		○ Adding in restrictions
			□ Adding semesters
				□ Students can only register for current semesters
				□ Instructors - only instructors teaching during those semesters can be matched to teach a course
	- Testing:
		○ Try to register for a class in a past semester
		○ Match courses to instructors - make sure only active teachers show up
			□ Not future or past

4th/Final iteration
	- Design:
		○ add more users
		○ Adding scheduling preference
		○ Add GUI 
	- Testing:
		○ Make sure with more users functionality is still working
		○ Try to register before it is that users preference
			□ Have multiple users with diff preferences 
				□ Make sure when it is not their time they cannot register
				□ When it is their time they can register
		○ Ensure GUI elements interaface properly with program
