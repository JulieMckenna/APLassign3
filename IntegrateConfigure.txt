Method: Integrate & Configure

	1. Database work
		a. Using assign 2 on how to interface with the databases
		b. Using prior sql knowledge to fill and create data 
		c. https://github.com/abhishek305/Registration-Form-With-database-using-python/blob/master/Registration%20form%20part%202.py
			i. A gui with database inserting values - lacks input validation
			ii. Already have some aspects of this part, know most is not all on how to do this.
			iii. Only thing would be searching for things in the database using user input for the queries
				- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29586273/searching-for-user-input-variable-string-in-sqlite-using-python
			- iv. https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mysql_getstarted.asp might want to use this if making a more permanant package
			
	2. Creating the program

				5) List courses - needed
				6) List course schedule
				7) Add course - need
			iii. Does not use a database - configure/add in 
			iv. Would be able to use parts of this code or as an example to see how they did some functions that I will need in the final CURSE.
				
	3. Creating a GUI/UI - if time create GUI
		a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-simple-registration-form-using-tkinter/
