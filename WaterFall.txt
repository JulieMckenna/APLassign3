- Julie McKenna

Method: Waterfall

Requirements:
	- Database of users
		○ Hold 100 students
		○ Hold 10 instructors
		○ 1 admin
	- Database of courses
		○ Each entry will consist of: CRN, course, times, instructor
	- There are 3 types of user
		○ Student

				□ Register for class
				□ See available classes 
				□ See their own schedule
		○ Instructor
			§ Functions:
				□ See their own courses

		○ Admin
			§ Functions:
				□ Can see everything(student/instructor courses and rosters)
				□ Add/remove courses
				□ Add/remove users
				□ Edit users/instructors/courses
	- Print out schedules
	- Multiple semesters of data
		○ Based on data filled into databases
	- Scheduling preferences
		○ For students - who gets priority
		○ How is priority handled?

System and software
	- Decide what language to use 
	- Create the users(student, instructor, admin)
	- Create a course 
	- Create a databases to hold the users
	- Create a database to hold the courses
	- Create user functions
		○ Student
		○ Instructor
		○ Admin
	- Create a scheduling preference
		○ Who goes first based off what criteria

Implementation and Unit Testing:
	- Create shared fucntionalities between User, Admin, and Instructor
	- Create specific functionalities for each user
	- Test user functionalities - behave as each of the user types 
		○ Check that each student can:
			§ Register for class
			§ See available classes 
			§ See their own schedule
		○ Check that each instructor can:
			§ See their own courses
			§ See available course
			§ See the course roster
		○ Check that each admin can:
			§ Can see everything(student/instructor courses and rosters)
			§ Add/remove courses
			§ Add/remove users
			§ Edit users/instructors/courses

Integration and system testing:
	- Add data to the course database that has different semesters
		○ Insure that students can only register for classes in the upcoming semester
		○ Does not show past or future semesters that are not available for scheduling
	- Add instructors that are before or past current semester
		○ Make sure that courses only match with instructors that are presently working at WIT
		○ Make sure instructors are assigned only classes in their major
	- Add students with different scheduling preference
		○ Make sure that those who have a higher preference go first
	- Register students for classes
		○ Make sure there are enough spots for a student - deny if class is full
		○ Make sure they can register within their own major - BSOC shouldn’t be able to register for ARCH classes
		○ Make sure all student can register for humanities
		○ If user drops class make sure the spot opens for another  user
		
Operation and maintenance:
	- Adding more users
	- Adding new features?
