Changes made by Julie:

- Integrate and Configure
1. Added some possible infomration that could be helpful when search that databases with user input
    could be used when search for courses based on a major
2. The GUI video that was found is going to be really helpful (just a comment)
    Has a lot of good information and I may refernce it when makinga GUI

- Waterfall
1. Added creating a menu to get user input
2. Switch validating user functions before creating a GUI  
    once program works - Then create GUI to control the program
3. At the end add in extras
    priority, and adding more users to test functionality with a full capacity in the db

-Incremental Development
1. In Step 4 after debugging adding in the extra functions
    like registration proprity
2. Could move basic GUI deisgn to step 3. 
    Do GUI in step 3 and 4. User terminal line until program has full functionality
